# Challenge

This is the instructions for the terminal challenge. Start in the folder "intro-challenge". Put all your commands in the file "answer.txt" that you will create in step 1.

* Create a file called "answer.txt". Here you can put your answers.
* Create a folder called "folder1".
* Step into "folder1" and create 3 files, "file1", "file2" and "file3".
* Edit "file1" and enter 10 words on separate lines. Save the file.
* Hide "file2". Test it by using the "ls" command with and without the option "-a".
* Change "file3" to "file3.txt".
* Go to the folder "intro-challenge" and copy "folder1" and all content to "folder2".
* Create a folder inside "folder2" called "temp".
* Move the folder "temp" from "folder2" to "folder1".
* Display the content in "folder2/file1".
* Redirect the output from last command to the file "folder1/file2".
* Echo the string "some text" and redirect the output into "folder1/file3.txt".
* Remove the file "folder1/file2"
* Remove the folder "folder1/temp"

* Make sure you are in the folder "intro-challenge". List all files with the long-listing option. Pipe the output and use "grep" to filter out only the folders. Redirect the result to the file "folder1/file1".
